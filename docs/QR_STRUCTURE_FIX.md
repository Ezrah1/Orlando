# 🔧 QR Code Structure Fix

## Issue Resolved

The text "Show this at check-in" was appearing inside the QR code area instead of below it as a separate instruction.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 🏗️ **New Structure:**

```html
<div class="qr-section">
  <h5>📱 Quick Check-in QR Code</h5>

  <div class="qr-code-container">
    <!-- QR Code image or placeholder goes here -->
  </div>

  <div class="qr-info">
    <div class="qr-ref">
      <strong>Ref: BOOKING123</strong>
    </div>
    <p>Show this at check-in</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 🔧 **Key Improvements:**

1. **Separated QR Code Container:**

   - `qr-code-container` holds only the QR code image/placeholder
   - Clean separation from text content
   - Proper flexbox centering

2. **Dedicated Info Section:**

   - `qr-info` contains booking reference and instructions
   - Text appears clearly below the QR code
   - Proper spacing and alignment

3. **Clean Placeholder:**
   - Simplified placeholder structure
   - Contains only "QR Code" text
   - No booking reference inside the QR area

### 📱 **Visual Result:**

**Before:**

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   QR Code       │
│   BOOKING123    │  ← Reference was inside QR
│   Show this...  │  ← Instruction was inside QR
└─────────────────┘
```

**After:**

```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
│    QR Code      │  ← Clean QR area
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
   Ref: BOOKING123   ← Reference below QR
 Show this at check-in ← Instruction below QR
```

### 🎯 **Benefits:**

1. **Clean QR Code:**

   - Only QR code image in the designated area
   - No text overlay or confusion
   - Professional appearance

2. **Clear Instructions:**

   - Text appears clearly below QR code
